# A structured “Review System” for Days 1–90

We layer in a structured review architecture so nothing decays.

This is how you prevent skill collapse.

## 🧠 The 1–90 Structured Review System

This system runs in parallel with your daily progression.

You never stop moving forward.
Review is layered on top.

## 📅 Weekly Structure (Core Rule)

Each week has:

5 New Days

1 Light Review Day

1 Deep Consolidation Day

Example:

| Day       | Focus              |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| Monday    | Day 21             |
| Tuesday   | Day 22             |
| Wednesday | Day 23             |
| Thursday  | Day 24             |
| Friday    | Day 25             |
| Saturday  | Light Review       |
| Sunday    | Deep Consolidation |

## 🔁 Light Review Day (20–30 min)

This is NOT repeating a full day.

Do this:

1️⃣ Random Verb Recall (10 min)

Pick 10 verbs from the past 20 days.

For each verb:

Say 3 sentences.

Add one modal.

Add one “weil” clause.

Example:

Ich arbeite heute, weil ich Zeit habe.

No notes.

2️⃣ Filler Integration (5 min)

Use:

Ehrlich gesagt…

Meiner Meinung nach…

Soweit ich weiß…

Im Grunde genommen…

Attach them to real sentences.

3️⃣ 5-Minute Monologue

Pick one topic:

Work

Plans

Progress

Opinions

No stopping.

🧱 Deep Consolidation Day (45 min)

This replaces a normal day once per week.

Structure:

Part 1 – Verb Clusters

Choose:

5 verbs from Days 1–30

5 verbs from Days 31–60

5 verbs from Days 61–90

Mix them in sentences.

Part 2 – Complexity Upgrade

Force:

weil

obwohl

wenn

dass

Example:

Ich denke, dass das wichtig ist.

Part 3 – 10-Minute Continuous Speech

No stopping.

No correction.

Use everything.

## 📊 Spaced Reinforcement Grid (Important)

Every 15 days, revisit:

| Current Day | Review        |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Day 15      | Review Day 1  |
| Day 30      | Review Day 10 |
| Day 45      | Review Day 15 |
| Day 60      | Review Day 20 |
| Day 75      | Review Day 30 |
| Day 90      | Review Day 45 |

This prevents decay.

## 🔥 Monthly Milestone Check (Day 30 / 60 / 90)

Record yourself speaking for:

10 minutes

No stopping

No preparation

Compare recordings.

This is your objective fluency metric.

## ⏱ Daily Micro Review Rule

Every day before new material:

5 random Anki cards from 30+ days ago

Speak 5 sentences from memory

This keeps old neural pathways alive.

## ⚖️ Golden Ratio Rule

70% Forward
30% Reinforcement

If review exceeds 30%, progress stalls.

If review is below 20%, retention decays.

## 🧩 Final System Summary

You have:

Linear daily progression (1–90)

Weekly light review

Weekly deep consolidation

15-day spaced reinforcement

Monthly recorded fluency audit

Daily micro review

That’s a complete loop.
